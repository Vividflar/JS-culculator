# JavaScript Calculator App (Week 5)

A simple, responsive calculator built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project was created as part of a learning assignment to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and UI layout using CSS Grid.

## 🚀 Features

- **Clear Display (AC)** – Resets calculator output to `0`.
- **Delete Last (⌫)** – Removes the last entered character.
- **Basic Operators** – Addition (+), Subtraction (−), Multiplication (×), and Division (÷).
- **Decimal Support** – Allows floating-point numbers using `.`.
- **Responsive Layout** – Buttons arranged neatly using CSS Grid.
- **Read-Only Input** – Prevents manual editing to ensure only button inputs are used.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Structure of the calculator.
- **CSS3** – Styling and layout (grid-based design).
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Functionality for calculations and input handling.

## ✨ Possible Improvements

- Add keyboard support (so users can type numbers and operators).  
- Improve error handling (e.g., dividing by zero).  
- Add memory functions (M+, M−, MR).  
- Style enhancements (animations, dark/light mode).
